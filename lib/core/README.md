# 🛠️ Core Layer

This folder contains resources that are **Shared** across the entire application.

**Rule of Thumb:**

- If a class or widget is used in **two or more** different features (e.g., used in both Auth and Profile), it belongs here.
- If it is specific to one feature, keep it inside `features/`.
